        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college</h1>
        <h2>Dear <b>Eileen</b>,</h2>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime to study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Start dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer. <br>

        <br>
        <h2>Study subjects</h2>
        <p>In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li>Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments, <br>
